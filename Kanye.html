<h1>Kanye West</h1>
<h4>Who is Kanye?</h4>
<p>Kanye West is an extremely famous hip hop producer turned artist and fashion entrepreneur, famous for his revolutionary Yeezy fashion brand and his smash hits like, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsO6ZnUZI0g" target="_blank">"Stronger"</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vwNcNOTVzY" target="_blank">"Gold Digger"</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAfFfqiYLp0" target="_blank">"All of the lights"</a>. While most famous for his rap career and the trendsetting innovations that he used in his music, Kanye was originally put on this scene with the uniqueness of his production and his use of "chipmunk soul", which he formed by taking samples of classic soul and rnb artists and editing the vocals and creating his own sound. West has notably produced for many famous artists of the late 90s and early 2000s, such as Jay Z, Ludacris, and Alicia Keys. However, after recording his first verse on "through the wire", he gave way to a fruitful rap career that would influence many of the listeners that would tune into his music.</p>
